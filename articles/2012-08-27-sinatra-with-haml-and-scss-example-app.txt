title: Sinatra with HAML and SCSS Example App
date: 27/08/2012

I really like Sinatra's simplicity but I find that I pretty much always prefer to use HAML and SCSS. I didn't want to have to think about everytime I created a new project. So I created a cloneable example for use with mini apps. It's also Heroku friendly. It's hosted on Github: <a href="https://github.com/okor/sinatra-haml-scss">https://github.com/okor/sinatra-haml-scss</a>. Some may find it helpful but it's there more for me, more than anything.
