title: Photos from the Bahamas
date: 30/07/2012

I took a trip to Grand Bahamas Island fairly recently. The Bahamas definitely weren't as awe inspiring as Bali, nor where they as crazy insane fun as Thailand. But I had a good time. Got stung by some fire coral. And I managed to snap a few shots.

Like normal, I used my trusty GH2 but this time I used the far superior <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IKLJVE/">LUMIX 20mm f/1.7</a>, a masterful lens. Very fast, very bright. Using the camera in darkness was like having night vision. Anyways, here are the pics.
