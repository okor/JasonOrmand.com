title: Introducing LEMPress, super easy Wordpress server setup
date: 20/07/2012

LEMPress is a script that makes setting up a <em>fast</em> Wordpress server very easy. It installs and configures NGINX, Varnish, MySQL and PHP on a clean Ubuntu 12.04 server.

I wrote LEMPress because my freelance work regularly requires working with Wordpress. So I wanted a consistent and easy way to set up servers for that purpose. I could have used something much more robust like Chef, but that's too complex for my needs. So I wrote this bash solution as a simpler alternative. With a bit more work, it could be a great de facto stack for deploying Wordpress sites.

Check out the instructions on Github: <a href="https://github.com/okor/LEMPress">LEMPress</a>.

<h2>Performance Benchmarking</h2>
Here's a simple performance benchmark for a Wordpress site deployed on the LEMPress stack. It's worth mentioning that I ran these tests from NY and the server is in TX. Not too shabby.

==============================

UPDATE: As of 09/29/2012, you can now preview posts/pages. There was a bug preventing previews, before this update. This change required modifying the Varnish configuration file. If you used LEMPress to set up your server before 09/29/2012, I recommend manually updating the file.
