title: Introducing LEMPress, super easy Wordpress server setup
date: 20/07/2012

LEMPress is a script that makes setting up a <em>fast</em> Wordpress server very easy. It installs and configures NGINX, Varnish, MySQL and PHP on a clean Ubuntu 12.04 server.

I wrote LEMPress because my freelance work often requires working with Wordpress. So I wanted a consistant and easy way to set up servers for that purpose. I could have used something much more robust like Chef, but that's too complex for my needs. So I came up with this bash solution that suited my needs precisely. I figured their were probably others in the same boat. With a bit more work, it could be a great defacto standard stack for deploying Wordpress sites.

Check out the instructions on Github: <a href="https://github.com/okor/LEMPress">LEMPress</a>.

<h2>Performance Benchmarking</h2>
Here's a simple perforance benchmark for a Wordpress site deployed on the LEMPress stack. It's worth mentioning that I ran these tests from NY and the server is in TX. Not too shabby.
