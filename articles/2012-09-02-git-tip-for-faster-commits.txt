title: Git Tip for faster commits
date: 02/09/2012

I save typing by using a git alias to shorten this: <code>git add -A && git commit -m</code> to this: <code>git z</code>. Beautiful. It's easy. Just create a custom alias like so: <code>git config \--global alias.z &#39;!git add -A && git commit -m&#39;</code>. That's it. Now I have a single and ultra-short command to add all untracked files, remove previously tracked but deleted files and commit with the following message.

So my commits look like this: <code>git z "added user model"</code>. I've considered creating another shorcut to push the current branch to origin.
